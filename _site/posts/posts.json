1: Coronavirus disease outbreaks twice in December 2020 and May 2021.\n\n\n\nFrom the figure 1, the most obvious finding is the active cases showing a binomial trend with two tops in December 2020 and May 2021.\nThe confirmed cases reached peaks before the active cases number reached the peak. This means the coronavirus test is effective. Besides, the active cases are 200-250 times than the confirmed cases. This means that the coronavirus spread very fast, and the control may need to be strengthened.\nThe death cases show a mineral peak after those two peaks. But generally, the number of death cases is creasing steadily.\nCovid-19 Vaccination Status\n\n\nShow code\n\nvaccine <- covidcase_raw %>% \n  select(date, total_vaccinations, people_vaccinated,

2: Until Aug 24, the vaccination doses are sufficient. 20% of people got at least one dose of vaccine, and 7% of people were fully vaccinated.\n\n\n\nFrom the figure 2, Since Apr 14, 2021, Iranian have started to get vaccinated. Before June, the vaccination doses are not sufficient - the difference between the number of fully vaccinated people and vaccination doses is small.\nSince mid-July, the number of vaccination doses increased sharply and the same as the number of partially vaccinated people. This means, from then on, the supply of vaccination doses was increased, and the government may have expanded publicity.\nIran and the neighboring countries\n\n\nShow code\n\nlibrary(tidycovid19)\nplot_covid19_stripes(\n  type = \"confirmed\",\n  countries = c(\"IRN\", \"AFG\", \"PAK\", \"TKM\", \"AZE\", \"TUR\", \"IRQ\", \"UAE\", \"OMN\",\"SA\"),\n  sort_countries = \"countries\"\n)\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Iran and Turkey have similar trends in new cases and are the highest in the neighboring area.\n\n\n\nAs 3 indicates, Iran and Turkey have the lightest color, which means they have more new confirmed cases in the neighboring area. According to the latest data, Afghanistan and Oman had put the coronavirus under control. On the contrary, the other countries still have very light colors on the right end.\nSome countries show the same trend of coronavirus bursts.

And the death cases were still high in the past few weeks.\nSame as the confirmed cases, death cases peaked simultaneously among countries except for Afghanistan and Oman in May and July 2021.\nReference\nR Packages\nC.

The data in this article is downloaded from Our World in Data1.\nThis article uses the data of South Africa from Jan1 2020, to Aug 29, 2021. The data for the first section of The Fact of COVID-19 Cases in South Africa contains the date, total cases, new cases, total deaths, and new deaths. The second section of Nucleic Acid Testing for COVID-19 Situation data includes the date, total test number per thousand people, new test number per thousand people, and positive rate.

From table 1, the new COVID-19 cases trend is generally a straight line every month. This indicates there are almost average new cases every day. The average number of new deaths cases is very different each month. By sorting the New Deaths/day column, January 2021 has the most deaths cases with a 509 per day averagely, and April 2021 has the least with 50 deaths per day. From the New Deaths Trend/month, except for February, March, and June, the other months fluctuate around the average deaths case number.
